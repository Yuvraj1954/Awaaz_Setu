## Overview
AwaazSetu is a **voice-first digital platform** designed to empower rural and non-tech users in India by providing **seamless access to essential government and healthcare information**.  
By bridging the gap between complex digital services and **local languages**, AwaazSetu ensures that technology truly serves the last mile.

---

## Problem Statement
In rural India, millions of citizens struggle to access government schemes and healthcare guidance due to:
- Low digital literacy
- Complex government portals
- Language barriers

Traditional search engines and websites assume typing, reading, and navigation skills that many users do not have. For most users, **spoken language is far more natural than text**.

## Why Voice-First for India?
- **Digital Literacy:** Speaking is easier than typing or navigating complex menus  
- **Local Languages:** Voice enables accessibility in Hindi and other Indian languages  
- **Low Friction:** Removes the need to learn app interfaces  
- **Trust:** Information delivered in a familiar tone and language feels more reliable

## How AwaazSetu Works
AwaazSetu acts as an intelligent voice bridge:

1. **Selection:** User chooses the service (Government or Healthcare) and preferred language  
2. **Interaction:** User taps the microphone and asks a question naturally  
3. **Intent Detection:** Backend analyzes the spoken (or typed) input  
4. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Relevant, pre-verified information is fetched  
5. **Guidance:** A short, spoken-style response is returned in Hindi or English
