## 📺 Mission Overview
**AwaazSetu** is a voice-first web platform engineered for the 300M+ Indians who face literacy and language barriers. While the internet is full of information, it is often inaccessible to rural populations. AwaazSetu turns complex government portals into a **simple, spoken conversation.**

## 🚀 Why AwaazSetu Wins

### 🛡️ 1. Zero-Hallucination Architecture
In critical sectors like **Healthcare** and **Government Schemes**, accuracy is non-negotiable. Unlike standard LLMs that might "hallucinate" fake rules, AwaazSetu uses a **Keyword-Based Intent System**. This ensures users get 100% verified, life-saving data every time.

### 🗣️ 2. The "Hinglish" Edge
Users in Bharat don't just speak Hindi or English—they speak a mix. Our NLP logic is optimized to recognize "Hinglish" commands, making the tech feel invisible and natural for the non-tech-savvy.

### 🌐 3. High Accessibility
Built with **Python Flask** and **Web Speech APIs**, it requires zero installation. It’s designed to be ultra-lightweight, running smoothly even on budget smartphones and 2G/3G networks.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
